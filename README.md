# Docker Stacks

A collection of example `docker-compose.yaml` files, to be used to learn about different software stacks.

Note: I don't intend to keep these up to date sufficiently to use them as-is for production use, however feel free to take inspiration, copy them as a starting point or fork for your own learning.

I intend to link to these examples from blogs, presentations and other learning resources. When I have done so, I will also update this README to link back to them, when I can.
